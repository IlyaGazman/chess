I am working on the ⟪project_name⟫ project.
I need to write unit tests in Jasmine for a model I will share with you

1. **Syntax rules** – **write tests in pure ES6***
2. **Jasmine** - Assume Jasmine dependencies already loaded into global
3. **Output format**
   - For each `.md` file I provide, create a matching test file **in the same folder**: same base name, `.js` extension.
   - Respond with **only** the full content of the generated files, in the exact template below—no extra prose.
   - import the model by absolute path

### path/to/test1.js
```
test1 content
```

---

### path/to/test2.js
```
test2 content
```

⟪files_for_context = exists
I will now share the model and the tests files
⟪files_for_context⟫
⟫

⟪prompt = exists
Additional guidance:
